# Smart Summarization

## Purpose

Generate concise, actionable summaries of conversations, documentation, codebases, or complex topics. Adapts format and depth based on content type and audience needs, focusing on essential information and immediate next steps.

## Claude Code Integration

### Slash Command Usage

```
/summary <target> [--format] [--depth]
```

**Target Types:**
- `conversation` - Summarize current chat session or discussion
- `@filename` - Summarize specific file or documentation
- `codebase` - Overview of entire project structure and purpose
- `<topic>` - Summarize any complex topic or concept

**Format Options:**
- `--conversation` - Structured conversation summary (default for discussions)
- `--technical` - Technical documentation format with implementation details
- `--meeting` - Meeting summary with decisions and action items
- `--executive` - High-level business summary for stakeholders
- `--quick` - Rapid overview with just essentials

**Depth Options:**
- `--brief` - Maximum 150 words, essential points only
- `--standard` - Standard 300 word limit with key details (default)
- `--detailed` - Extended summary with context and background

## Usage Examples

### Conversation Summary
```
/summary conversation
```

**Structured Output:**
```markdown
# Conversation Summary

## TLDR

• Consolidated 60+ duplicate commands into unified Claude Code commands
• Created new schema and template following Claude Code syntax patterns
• Successfully merged dependencies, parallel, explain, review, plan, and summary commands

## Key Decisions

• Use Claude Code slash command syntax (/command-name)
• Implement file reference system (@filename) and bash integration (!command)
• Consolidate duplicates while preserving all functionality
• Apply new template structure to all remaining commands

## Action Items

• **User**: Review consolidated commands for accuracy and completeness
• **Claude**: Complete consolidation of remaining similar commands
• **Next**: Apply new structure to all 60+ commands in the collection

## Open Questions / Blockers

• Permission denied error when removing duplicate files (left in place)
• Need validation of new Claude Code integration features

## Next Steps

1. Complete consolidation of all duplicate and similar commands
2. Apply Claude Code template to remaining unconsolidated commands
3. Test consolidated commands for functionality and syntax compliance
4. Update VDK project to generate Claude Code specific commands

## Code Snippets

```yaml
# Claude Code command frontmatter structure
claudeCode:
  slashCommand: "/command-name"
  arguments:
    supports: true
    examples: ["example1", "example2"]
  fileReferences:
    supports: true
    autoInclude: ["CLAUDE.md"]
  bashCommands:
    supports: true
    commands: ["git status", "npm run"]
```

```bash
# Consolidation commands used
/dependencies audit
/parallel setup
/explain function_name --elaborate
```
```

### Technical Documentation Summary
```
/summary @docs/architecture.md --technical
```

**Technical Format:**
```markdown
# TL;DR: System Architecture

## 🎯 What It Does

Microservices architecture with event-driven communication, API gateway, and service mesh for scalable e-commerce platform.

## ✅ Key Components

- **API Gateway**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **User Service**: Account management, authentication, profiles
- **Order Service**: Order processing, payment integration, fulfillment
- **Inventory Service**: Stock management, reservations, availability
- **Event Bus**: Kafka-based asynchronous communication

## 🚀 To Get Started

1. **Local Development**: `docker-compose up` with provided development stack
2. **Configuration**: Update `.env` files for each service
3. **First Test**: `curl localhost:8080/health` to verify gateway connectivity

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data, no shared databases
- **Event Ordering**: Use Kafka partitioning for events requiring ordering
- **Circuit Breakers**: All external calls protected with Hystrix patterns
- **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing required for debugging across services

## 📚 Key Resources

- **Service Discovery**: Consul configuration in `/config/consul/`
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs in each service `/docs/` folder
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards in `/monitoring/dashboards/`
- **Contact**: Platform team - platform@company.com
```

### Codebase Overview
```
/summary codebase --quick
```

**Quick Overview Format:**
```markdown
# TL;DR: Project Codebase

## Bottom Line

Node.js/TypeScript API server with React frontend, PostgreSQL database, and comprehensive test suite - ready for production deployment.

## Key Structure

- **`/src/api/`**: Express.js REST API with authentication and business logic
- **`/src/frontend/`**: React/TypeScript SPA with modern UI components
- **`/src/database/`**: Prisma ORM with migrations and seed data
- **`/tests/`**: Jest unit tests and Cypress integration tests (85% coverage)
- **`/docker/`**: Production-ready containerization and deployment configs

## To Start Developing

1. **Install**: `npm install` (requires Node.js 18+)
2. **Database**: `npm run db:setup` (requires PostgreSQL)
3. **Development**: `npm run dev` (starts API + frontend)

## Critical Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 14+
- **Key Libraries**: Express, React, Prisma, Jest
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, nginx (production)

### Meeting Summary
```
/summary last-meeting --meeting
```

**Meeting Format:**
```markdown
# Meeting Summary: Architecture Review

## Decisions Made

- **Database Strategy**: Adopt PostgreSQL with read replicas for scaling
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 with Auth0 integration
- **API Design**: Follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all endpoints
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage required for all services

## Action Items

- **Sarah (Tech Lead)**: Create PostgreSQL migration plan by Jan 30
- **Mike (Backend)**: Implement Auth0 integration by Feb 5
- **Lisa (Frontend)**: Update API client for OAuth flow by Feb 10
- **DevOps Team**: Set up staging environment with new auth by Feb 15

## Open Questions

- **Performance**: How will read replicas affect consistency requirements?
- **Cost**: Auth0 pricing at projected user scale needs validation
- **Migration**: Downtime window for database migration TBD

## Risks Identified

- **Timeline Risk**: Auth0 integration more complex than initially estimated
- **Dependencies**: Frontend work blocked until backend OAuth complete
- **Testing**: Additional test infrastructure needed for OAuth flows

## Next Meeting

- **Date**: February 1, 2025 at 2:00 PM
- **Agenda**: Review Auth0 integration progress and migration timeline
- **Preparation**: Each team lead provides detailed implementation plan
```
