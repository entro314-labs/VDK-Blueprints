- **Admission controllers**: OPA Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
- **SBOM generation**: Track dependencies and licenses

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Enable Pod Security Standards
- Implement RBAC with minimal privileges
- Configure network policies for critical workloads

### Phase 2: Advanced Controls (Weeks 3-4)

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Privilege Escalation**: 67% of attacks exploit excessive privileges
2. **Secrets Management**: Hardcoded secrets in 34% of containers
3. **Network Exposure**: Unprotected inter-pod communication

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular security audits with tools like kube-bench
- Automated compliance checking with Falco rules
- Continuous vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

## Industry Insights

### Current Trends (2024)

# GraphQL vs REST API: 2024 Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

### Market Position
- **REST**: 78% adoption in enterprise APIs (mature, stable)
- **GraphQL**: 34% adoption, growing 23% YoY (rapid growth in specific sectors)
- **Hybrid**: 43% of organizations use both (strategic complementarity)

### Key Finding
Neither technology is universally superior - choice depends on specific use cases, team expertise, and architectural requirements.

## Detailed Comparison Matrix

| Factor | REST | GraphQL | Winner |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium-High | REST |
| **Caching** | Excellent (HTTP) | Complex | REST |
| **Mobile Optimization** | Manual optimization | Built-in efficiency | GraphQL |
| **Tooling Ecosystem** | Mature, extensive | Growing, sophisticated | REST |
| **Type Safety** | Limited | Strong (schema-first) | GraphQL |
| **API Evolution** | Versioning challenges | Schema evolution | GraphQL |
| **Performance** | Predictable | Variable (N+1 problem) | Depends |

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose REST When:
- **Simple CRUD operations**: Straightforward resource manipulation
- **Caching critical**: Heavy read workloads with predictable patterns
- **Team experience**: Limited GraphQL expertise
- **Third-party integrations**: Most external APIs are REST
- **Microservices**: Service-to-service communication

### Choose GraphQL When:
- **Frontend-driven development**: React, Vue, Angular with complex UIs
- **Mobile applications**: Bandwidth optimization crucial
- **Rapid prototyping**: Flexible schema evolution needed
- **Data aggregation**: Multiple sources, complex relationships
- **Type safety important**: Strong typing requirements

### Hybrid Approach:
- **External APIs**: REST for public APIs (wider compatibility)
- **Internal APIs**: GraphQL for frontend-backend communication
- **Legacy integration**: REST for existing system integration
- **New features**: GraphQL for modern, complex interfaces

## Performance Analysis

### REST Advantages
- **HTTP caching**: Browser, CDN, proxy caching works naturally
- **Predictable queries**: Easier to optimize and monitor
- **Simple debugging**: Standard HTTP tools work everywhere

### GraphQL Advantages
- **Reduced round trips**: Single query for complex data
- **Precise data fetching**: No over-fetching or under-fetching
- **Real-time capabilities**: Built-in subscription support

### Performance Benchmarks (2024)
- **Simple queries**: REST 15% faster (less parsing overhead)
- **Complex data**: GraphQL 40% faster (fewer network calls)
- **Mobile networks**: GraphQL 60% less data transfer

## Migration Considerations

### REST to GraphQL
```typescript
// Gradual migration strategy
// 1. Start with GraphQL gateway over REST APIs
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl: federatedSchema,
  buildService: ({ url }) => new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({ url })
});

// 2. Gradually replace REST endpoints with native GraphQL
// 3. Maintain both during transition period
```

### GraphQL to REST
```typescript
// Extract stable patterns into REST endpoints
// 1. Identify frequent, stable queries
// 2. Create dedicated REST endpoints for performance
// 3. Keep GraphQL for exploratory/dynamic queries
```
