# Code & Project Review

## Purpose

Comprehensive review system for code changes, architecture, and project components. Combines high-level strategic analysis with detailed security, quality, and performance reviews. Adapts review depth and focus based on target and context.

## Claude Code Integration

### Slash Command Usage

```
/review <target> [--mode] [--focus]
```

**Target Types:**
- `latest` - Review most recent git changes (commits, staged, unstaged)
- `@filename` - Review specific file or component
- `architecture` - High-level architectural review
- `security` - Security-focused audit
- `performance` - Performance analysis
- `<concept>` - Review any project aspect

**Review Modes:**
- `--quick` - High-level strategic analysis (5-10 minutes)
- `--standard` - Comprehensive review with actionable findings (15-20 minutes)
- `--deep` - Thorough audit with detailed recommendations (30+ minutes)

**Focus Areas:**
- `--security` - Prioritize security vulnerabilities and risks
- `--performance` - Focus on performance and optimization
- `--quality` - Emphasize code quality and maintainability
- `--testing` - Test coverage and testing strategy

### Automatic Context Gathering

The command intelligently analyzes the review target:

**Git Changes Analysis**: !`git status && git diff --staged && git diff`

**Recent History**: !`git log -3 --oneline --stat`

**Project Structure**: !`find . -type f -name "*.{js,ts,py,rs,go,java}" | head -20`

**Configuration Files**: !`find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.{json,yaml,toml,md}" -type f`

## Usage Examples

### Git Changes Review
```
/review latest
```

**Review Process:**
1. **Change Detection**: Analyzes staged, unstaged, and recent commit changes
2. **Security Scan**: Checks for credentials, injection vulnerabilities, data exposure
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates coding standards, error handling, conventions
4. **Test Coverage**: Ensures new code has appropriate tests
5. **Performance Review**: Identifies algorithmic issues and inefficiencies
6. **Documentation Check**: Verifies comments and documentation updates

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
# Code Review: Latest Changes

## Change Summary
- **Files Modified**: 5 files (3 source, 2 tests)
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +127/-43
- **Commit**: feat: add user authentication middleware

## Security Review ✅

### Critical Issues (0)
_No critical security issues found_

### Medium Issues (1)
- **src/auth/middleware.ts:23**: Password comparison should use constant-time function
  ```typescript
  // Current (timing attack vulnerable)
  if (password === storedPassword) {
  
  // Recommended
  if (crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(password), Buffer.from(storedPassword))) {
  ```

### Low Issues (2)
- **src/config/database.ts:15**: Consider using environment-specific connection pools
- **src/utils/logger.ts:8**: Log sanitization could be improved for PII data

## Code Quality Review ✅

### Strengths
- ✅ Consistent TypeScript usage and strict mode enabled
- ✅ Proper error handling with custom error classes
- ✅ Follows project naming conventions from CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Good separation of concerns in middleware design

### Issues Found
- **src/auth/middleware.ts:45-52**: Complex conditional could be extracted to utility function
- **src/services/userService.ts:89**: Missing JSDoc for complex algorithm
- **src/types/auth.ts:12**: Interface could extend base types for consistency

## Test Coverage Review ⚠️

### Coverage Analysis
- **New Code Coverage**: 78% (target: 85%)
- **Missing Tests**: Authentication edge cases, error scenarios
- **Test Quality**: Good unit tests, needs integration tests

### Recommendations
- Add tests for invalid token scenarios
- Test middleware with malformed requests
- Add integration test for full auth flow

## Performance Review ✅

### No Performance Issues Found
- Async/await properly used
- No N+1 query patterns detected
- Efficient data structures chosen

## Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Fix timing attack vulnerability** (src/auth/middleware.ts:23)
2. **Add missing test coverage** for authentication edge cases
3. **Update API documentation** for new auth endpoints

### Medium Priority
1. Extract complex conditional to utility function
2. Add JSDoc for complex algorithms
3. Improve log sanitization for PII data

### Low Priority
1. Consider connection pool optimization
2. Standardize interface inheritance patterns

## Overall Assessment: ✅ APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

**Strengths**: Well-structured authentication implementation with good error handling
**Concerns**: Timing attack vulnerability needs immediate attention
**Recommendation**: Fix security issue and add tests before merging
```

### File-Specific Review
```
/review @src/auth/middleware.ts --security
```

**Security-Focused Analysis:**
1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated detection of common security issues
2. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Reviews for security anti-patterns
3. **Dependency Security**: Checks imports for known vulnerabilities
4. **Data Flow Analysis**: Traces sensitive data handling
5. **Access Control Review**: Evaluates authorization logic

### Architectural Review
```
/review architecture --quick
```

**High-Level Analysis:**
```markdown
# Architecture Review: Project Structure

## Strengths ✅
- **Clear separation**: Well-defined layers (controllers, services, data)
- **Consistent patterns**: Uniform approach to error handling and validation
- **Dependency management**: Clean dependency injection without circular references
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with proper defaults

## Weaknesses ⚠️
- **Monolithic structure**: Single large service could benefit from modularization
- **Database coupling**: Direct SQL queries scattered across services
- **Missing abstractions**: No clear interface for external API calls

## Key Recommendations
1. **Introduce Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations behind interfaces
2. **Extract Core Modules**: Split user management and auth into separate bounded contexts
3. **Add API Client Layer**: Centralize external service calls with retry/circuit breaker patterns

## Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
**Technical Debt**: Manageable but growing
**Scalability**: Current structure supports 10x growth with minimal changes
**Maintainability**: Good foundation, needs better abstractions for long-term health
```
