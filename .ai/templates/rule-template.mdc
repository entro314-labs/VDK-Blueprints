# Your Rule Title

## Universal Guidelines

These guidelines apply regardless of the AI assistant platform:

### Primary Guideline
- State your main rule or principle clearly
- Use active voice and specific language
- Provide context for why this matters

### Secondary Guidelines
- Additional principles that support the main guideline
- Each guideline should be actionable
- Include specific examples where helpful

### Best Practices
- List established patterns or conventions
- Explain the reasoning behind each practice
- Reference industry standards where applicable

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### Claude Code
When implementing this rule with Claude Code:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Use specific tools to understand context
   - Describe step-by-step investigation process
   - Identify patterns to look for

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Use appropriate tools for changes
   - Follow systematic approach
   - Maintain consistency with project patterns

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify implementation correctness
   - Check for unintended side effects
   - Ensure integration with existing code

### Cursor
Auto-triggers when working with relevant files:

- Describe when and how the rule activates
- What suggestions or completions to provide
- How to validate user's implementation
- Integration with existing Cursor features

### Windsurf
<your-rule-tag>
- Provide concise, memory-optimized instructions
- Focus on key principles and patterns
- Include essential validation points
- Maintain consistency with project architecture
</your-rule-tag>

### GitHub Copilot
Focus on these aspects during code review:

- Key validation points for this rule
- Common mistakes to flag
- Best practices to encourage
- Integration with existing review processes

## Code Examples

### Basic Implementation
```language
// ✅ Good: Clear example of correct implementation
// Include complete, working code snippets
// Show imports, types, and context

// ❌ Bad: Example of what NOT to do
// Explain why this approach is problematic
```

### Advanced Implementation
```language
// ✅ More complex example showing advanced usage
// Include error handling and edge cases
// Demonstrate integration with related patterns
```

### Integration Pattern
```language
// ✅ Show how this rule integrates with other patterns
// Include context about when to use this approach
// Demonstrate proper architectural integration
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Implementation Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Specific things NOT to do
- ❌ Common mistakes developers make
- ❌ Patterns that seem correct but are problematic
- ❌ Explain why each anti-pattern is harmful

### Design Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Architectural decisions to avoid
- ❌ Integration approaches that cause issues
- ❌ Scaling problems that arise from poor patterns
- ❌ Maintenance challenges from bad design

## Integration Notes
